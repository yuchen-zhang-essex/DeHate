# DeHATE: A Holistic Hateful Video Dataset

**DeHATE** is a large-scale multimodal dataset for the detection and localization of explicit and implicit hate in short-form videos. The dataset comprises over 6,000 annotated videos collected from TikTok and BitChute, spanning six social groups, with fine-grained segment-level labels.

This repository contains:
- The cleaned annotation data in `.csv` format
- Documentation and statistics on label distributions, segment, modality, and group breakdowns

---

## Dataset Summary

DeHATE includes:
- Videos from two platforms: TikTok (highly regulated) and BitChute (loosely moderated)
- Annotation of both explicit and implicit hate
- Segment-level localization (timestamps for hateful content)
- Modality labels (text, audio, visual)
- Six target groups: Race, Gender, Religion, Sexual Orientation, Disability, Immigration
